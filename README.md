# Crowd Counting And Monitoring Videos For Surveillance


A Crowd is a gathering of numbers of people at some place. It is not feasible to count/monitor all the people at various places like university, shopping malls, railway stations, airports or at any other place by looking at them. The complexity of monitoring, tracking and counting increases as the size of the crowd increases. We canâ€™t monitor the crowd for suspicious behavior as well.

However, with the introduction of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera this problem has been solved up to some extent. But still we are not able to track/monitor a large group of people with CCTV. In recent years numerous application of computer vision has come. Researchers are trying to monitor, and count the crowd automatically with the help of machine intelligence. It can be significantly advantageous if we can detect the objects from the videos/cameras. 

From a technological perspective, detecting, tracking, and analyzing peoples like detecting and tracking a person walking in a university, or identifying the communication between two people, computer vision solutions typically focused on these areas. Generally, there are number of CCTV cameras installed at various places to record the environment. But, the tough task is that it is not feasible for human operator to sit all the time in front of the CCTV and monitor/count the crowd. There is a need of an automated system which can provide us some meaningful information from live or recorded videos.
